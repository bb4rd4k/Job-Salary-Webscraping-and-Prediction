# Web Scraping for Indeed.com and Predicting Salaries

This is an assignment I did during the Data Science Immersive course I took at General Assembly. In this project, I practice two major skills: collecting data by scraping a website, and building a binary predictor with Logistic Regression.
I collect salary information on data science jobs in Indeed.com using BeautifulSoup. Then, using the location, title, and summary of the job, I attempt to predict the salary of the job. I convert this problem into classification and use Logistic Regression to predict salaries.

The notebook for this project can be best read at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mdealiaga/Job-Salary-Webscraping-and-Prediction/blob/master/Web%20Scraping%20Job%20Data.ipynb.

It can also be seen directly in Github at https://github.com/mdealiaga/Job-Salary-Webscraping-and-Prediction/blob/master/Web%20Scraping%20Job%20Data.ipynb.
